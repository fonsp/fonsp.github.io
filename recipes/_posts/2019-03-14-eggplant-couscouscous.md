# Eggplant couscous üçÜ

*20 minutes*

In this recipe we will make a quick and easy **couscous salad**, mixed with raw veggies. We will then add my two favourite foods: **falafel** and **grilled eggplant**! By searing the eggplant on high heat, it keeps all of its yummy flavours, which goes great with the sharpness of our onion and lemon.

## Ingredients

*For 1 hungry person*

Salad:

- 150g couscous
- 2 small onions
- veggies for your salad (e.g. cucumber, radish, bell pepper, parsley or tomato)
- 50g peanuts, pealed
- 1 lemon
- lots of powdered cumin!



Eggplant & falafel:

- 1 eggplant
- vegetable oil (e.g. peanut oil)
- salt & pepper
- cayenne pepper (or chili flakes, harissa, etc.)
- 150g falafel



## Preparation

Salad:

1. Prepare your couscous following the packaging instructions.
1. Chop the onion into very fine pieces. I like to add the onion as-is, but you could fry the onion for a few minutes if you prefer. 
1. Add onions, and add all other chopped veggies.
1. Add cumin and salt to taste.



Eggplant & falafel:

1. Chop the eggplant into chunks or slices 1cm thick. While still on the chopping board, garnish with lots of salt and some pepper and cayenne. Make sure all sides are covered.
1. Warm up a frying pan (or grilling pan, if you have one) on high heat, and add a fair amount of vegetable oil. 
1. Still on high heat, grill the eggplant on both sides. Use extra oil if necessary. Add to the salad.
1. Using the same oiled pan, prepare the falafel on medium heat.



Mix everything in a salad bowl, and add squeezed lemon juice. 

*Enjoy!*
